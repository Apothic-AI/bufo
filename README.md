# bufo

`bufo` is a TUI and Web UI framework for AI agents.

Bufo is a reusable UI framework for AI agents.

Its core value is developer experience: you can bring your own ACP-compatible agent project and get a production-grade UI without building one from scratch.

Bufo blends shell-native workflows and agentic AI with a framework that is easy to adapt and white-label.
